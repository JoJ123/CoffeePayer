# CoffeePayer

Simple Application to choose one payer out of a set of RFID Cards, like the ones that are used in a lot of companies.

Since long time at the coffeebar we were dicing to select the "winner" to pay the coffee.

With this application you can scan the RFID-cards of you collegues and pick the "winner".

Colleagues, you drink often coffee with, could be added as contacts to list them with their names, all other cards will be added with a Guest Name.

You can download the application from the Google Play Store:
